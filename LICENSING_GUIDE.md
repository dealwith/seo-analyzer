## Understanding AGPL-3.0

### What AGPL-3.0 Requires:

1. **Source Code Availability**
   - If you modify and distribute, you must share source
   - If you run as a web service, users must access source
   - Include LICENSE and copyright notices

2. **Same License**
   - Your modifications must be AGPL-3.0
   - Combined works must be AGPL compatible

3. **Network Use = Distribution**
   - Unlike GPL, AGPL treats network use as distribution
   - Running as SaaS requires source disclosure
   - This is the key difference from MIT/Apache licenses

✅ Use for personal projects
✅ Use for commercial purposes (if you comply)
✅ Modify the code
✅ Distribute the code
✅ Use in open-source projects

### What AGPL-3.0 Prohibits:

❌ Keeping modifications proprietary
❌ Running as closed-source SaaS

## Common Questions

### Q: I modified the code. Do I need to share my changes?

**AGPL-3.0**: Yes, if you distribute the software or run it as a service.
**Commercial**: No, you can keep modifications private.

### Q: We're a startup with $500K revenue planning to grow. What license?

**Answer**: Start with AGPL-3.0 (free). When you exceed $1M revenue, transition to commercial license. We can backdate the license if needed.

### Q: Can I try it first before buying a commercial license?

**Answer**: Yes! Use AGPL-3.0 for evaluation. Switch to commercial before production deployment if you cannot comply with AGPL terms.

### Q: What happens if we use AGPL but don't share source code?

**Answer**: That's a license violation. We may:
1. Request compliance
2. Charge for retroactive commercial license
3. Pursue legal action for willful infringement

### Q: Can we sponsor development instead of buying a license?

**Answer**: Yes! Contact us for sponsorship opportunities. Major sponsors may receive commercial license benefits.

### Q: Do consultants/agencies need a license for each client?

**Answer**: Yes, for:
- Multi-year commitments
- Non-profit organizations
- Educational institutions
